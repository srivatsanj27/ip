#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs one UI test case: feeds an input file to the compiled Ace program as
# stdin, captures stdout, and diffs it against an expected-output file.
#
# Usage: run_ui_test.sh <input-file> <expected-file> [classes-dir] [main-class]
#
# Exit code 0 = actual output matched expected exactly. Exit code 1 = mismatch
# (diff is printed). This script does not decide whether to continue to the
# next test case — the caller (the skill) stops the session on the first
# non-zero exit, per the project's "fail fast" testing requirement.
